        <h2 class="text-xl xs:text-2xl text-gray-900">The video shows...</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          ...the sound of the <span class="italic">vastus lateralis</span> muscle during squats and jumps performed by three different athletes.
          As the tension in the muscle increases towards the bottom of the squats and jumps, the frequency of the modulated sound signal also increases, providing auditory feedback of muscle activity.

        <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl xs:text-2xl text-gray-900">The project</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The project aims to transform mechanical muscle activity into sound as a form of real time biofeedback for physiology, health and sports training applications.
          Muscle activity is measured with MC (muscle contraction) sensors and is used to synthesize a corresponding sound such that the amplitude and frequency of the synthesized sound correlate with the amplitude of the MC signal.
          The sound, played back in near-to-real time (~10 ms latency), gives the user essentially real-time auditory feedback of their muscle activity.

              The video shows a time-domain plot of a simulated 1 kHz MC signal data stream, while the corresponding modulated sound signal is computed and played back in real time—as the MC signal increases, the sound signal's frequency increases.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1">
              Details: the modulated sound is played back at 16 kHz and computed with a 5 ms audio buffer; the plot shows a 1500 ms window of MC signal data and is updated every 30 ms. Audio playback is in sync with the right-most portion of the plotted MC signal.

          shows that the MC signal correlates strongly with numerous useful parameters describing muscle activity, such as the force and electromyogram (EMG) signals in the muscle. As a result the synthesized sound, whose volume and frequency correlate with the strength of the MC signal, provides auditory feedback of muscle activity.

        <p class="mt-3">
          Sensor hardware (the MC sensor; see the <a href="#references" class="hover:text-blue-600 hover:underline">references</a>) and a prototype real-time sound modulation algorithm have already been developed.
          The algorithm has been tested using a simulated MC signal datastream sampled at 1 kHz (the sample rate of the MC sensor) on a laptop personal computer using the ALSA audio framework and the PortAudio library for sound I/O.
